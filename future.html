<h1>Into the Future</h1>
<p>I've been searching for my next career for a while now. I've been hoping around from job to job yet nothing seems to stick...until now. I'm enrolled in the Galvanize Web Immersive Program to hopefully, <em>finally</em>, answer the question, "what do you want to be when you grow up?"</p>

<h3>Previous Jobs</h3>

  <p>Ways I've paid the bills, or atleast tried to:</p>
    <ul class = "1">
      <li>hostess</li>
      <li>hotel concierge</li>
      <li>nanny</li>
      <li>barrista</li>
      <li>concert venue vendor</li>
      <li>waitress</li>
      <li>pr intern</li>
      <li>project manager</li>
      <li>cashier</li>
      <li>museum docent</li>
      <li>archaeology technician</li>
      <li>retail associate</li>
      <li>wedding coordinator</li>
      <li>events manager</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Previous Education</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>B.S. of Business Administration | Marketing with Spanish minor | Colorado State University 2006</li>
    <li>High School Diploma | Sandia High School 2002</li>
  </ul>

<h3>The Future</h3>
    <p>Now I begin my Galvanize journey which will give me the tools to land my first tech job! I'd love to work at a company that is seeking to change the world and improve the future by combating climate change. Climate change is affected by <em>so many</em> factors, not just the obvious things like recycling or solar power, which is great because it means I can make a difference in lots of unique ways like improving women's eduction or making transportation more efficient. In fact, my excitement about the future has got me like this kid circa 1992. Onward! </p>
